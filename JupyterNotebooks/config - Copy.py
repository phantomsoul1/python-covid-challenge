#CAUTION: DO NOT COMMIT/PUSH ANY VERSION OF THIS FILE THAT CONTAINS ACTUAL API KEYS! Instead, create a placeholder for a #particular API, like the one seen above (or like the ones provided with our homeworks) and commit/push that to the repository.
#Otherwise, your API key may permanently be visible in the public (anyone can read) GitHub repository.
